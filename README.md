Technologies 
Today there are many ways to communicate but not everyone is interested in knowing how is it possible to carry out this action, we are in a very technological world, every day communications are more possible through video calls, chats, emails, that is why computer networks have a great importance for all this to be possible used 

In this project were developed by using: 
	The XMPP protocol 
	A programming language in this case was Python 
	Utilities or libraries that allow the use of this technology in this case was SlikXmpp
	A network domain to be able to create connections wherever we are The functionalities implemented 
	Start sessions 
	Account Management (create, delete) 
	Communication (chat 1 a 1, Group chat, file transfers)
